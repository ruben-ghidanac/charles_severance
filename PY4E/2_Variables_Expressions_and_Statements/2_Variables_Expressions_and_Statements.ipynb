    "A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. The values we have seen so far are `1`, `2`, and `\"Hello, World!\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "These values belong to different types: `2` is an **integer**, and `\"Hello, World!\"` is a **string**, so called because it contains a \"string\" of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.\n",

    "Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type `str` and integers belong to the type `int`. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called `float`, because these numbers are represented in a format called **floating point**.\n",

    "What about values like `\"17\"` and `\"3.2\"`? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings.\n",

    "When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in `1,000,000`. This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is legal:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "    >>> print(1,000,000)\n",
    "    1 0 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "Well, that's not what we expected at all! Python interprets `1,000,000` as a comma-separated sequence of integers, which it prints with spaces between.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first example we have seen of a semantic error: the code runs without producing an error message, but it doesn't do the \"right\" thing."
